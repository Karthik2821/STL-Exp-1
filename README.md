# Ex.No: 1 Write programs in Python Language to demonstrate the working of followingconstructs with possible test cases: a) do…while b) while…do c) if …else d) switch e) for 

### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 

### AIM:  
To write python programs for do…while, while, for, switch and if…else and test with possible test 
Cases 

### Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Create separate files for each given program.
3. Write simple program for each construct.
4.  the program with possible test cases.
5. Stop the program.
### Program:

a) do...while

## Result:

Thus, the python program to demonstrate the working of given constructs is implemented and the output is verified successfully.
